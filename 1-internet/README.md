# INTERNET

## History Of Internet.
The internet originated from an experiment carried out by the defence department. This project was called ARPANET. 
> ARPANET: Advanced Research Project Agency Network
The experiment was aimed at building a communication system that may survive nuclear disasters/attacks. His design was breaking messages into blocks and sending them fast through the meshed network. The messages are scattered into packets(these packets hold small bits of the message as a whole.) which are then sent through one origin node, scattered throughout the various nodes of the network and reassemble at the destination node to form whatever was sent as the information in the first place. 

## Components Of The Internet
The internet is made up of a large number of independently  operated networks. This system is **fully distributed**: there is no central network that is controlling the whole.

## Information Transfer on the Internet.
All sorts of information() regulated on the internet are transferred from one end to the other as bits(0's and 1's)
